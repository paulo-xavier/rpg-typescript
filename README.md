## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge consists in create a RPG game using Classes in Typescript. This exercise contains 5 iterations, and in each iteration you'll have to implement a new functionality to your RPG classes. The main goal of this exercise is to forces you to change your code and implement new classes or inheritances. To advance to next iteration is recommended to finish the current iteration. This exercise is similar a method used in Japan called Kata. Kata consists in make some activity a lot of times, in order to get practice and become master at that.

## My process

### Built with

- Typescript
- Typescript Classes



### What I learned

This exercise was very important because I've got to reinforce my learnings in Classes using Typescript. These type of exercises are fantastic because they allow you to repeat that concept applying new functionalities and improving the code. Each iteration was a big challenge, precisely because a new implementation always were required. So it helped me a lot to improve my knowledge in Typescript and classes, using inheritance and polymorphism. 

### Continued development

I'm totally satisfied with my overcome. It was one of my favorite codes developed using Typescript, it was a big journey until I got this result. First I've learned the basis of Typescript, using if/else, while and for, and now, deeper in Typescript, I've learned Classes and OOP. This is a code that allows me to see a great improvement in my logical thinking and solve problems capability. I'm completely happy with my final result.
